Learning ggplot2 & R Markdown
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. I will be using my Flappy Bird scores as a sample dataset.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r, echo=F}
#Setting Up
library('ggplot2')
flappybird <- read.table("~/2 Second Year/Stats/Flappy Bird/f.csv", quote="\"")
colnames(flappybird)<-c("Scores")
flappybird$Time <- 1:nrow(flappybird)
```

```{r}
summary(flappybird)
head(flappybird)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
f <- qplot(Time,Scores,data=flappybird,main="Scatterplot of Flappy Bird Scores Over Time")
show(f)
# Change font of titles
f <- f + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.8), colour = "gray25"))
# Change font of Axis Labels
f <- f + theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "italic", size=rel(1.2), colour = "navy"))
show(f)
```
